# factoring-primes-using-linear-algebra
This project was developed for Linear Algebra classes at University of São Paulo, Computer Science course
It uses linear algebrics concepts like echelon-form matrix and gaussian elimination so it returns a non-trivial factor that divides a non-prime number, as well as two numbers A and B such as  A² - B² = N²
